This is a python to C++ translation of Panda3d sample/tutorial:
Tut-Ball-in-Maze.py

*Developped using
Panda3D SDK 1.7.2 (panda3d1.7_1.7.2~maverick_i386.deb)
Eclipse SDK 3.5.2 / CDT 6.0.2
Ubuntu 10.10 (maverick)

*Note to Eclipse CDT users:
First import the project into your workspace. To do so:
File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace
Then click Next and Browse to the sample program directory. Check `Copy projects into workspace' if needed and you're Finish'ed.

In order to compile the project, you'll need to define a path variable pointing to directory `p3util'. Since path variables exist within the workspace (as opposed to a project), /this step will only need to be done once/. To do so move to:
Project > Properties > C/C++ General > Path and Symbols > Source Location
Then, click button `Link Folder...',
click button `Advanced >>',
check box `Link to folder in the file system',
click button `Variables...',
click button `New...',
fill field `Name:' with "P3UTILPATH",
click button `Folder...',
browse to folder `p3util',
and then click buttons `OK' until you exit the Project Properties.


The main objective of this work is for me to learn about Panda3d, C++ and 3d 
games in general. Has such, it aims at being a C++ program while remaining 
close to the original python script. I hope you find it helpful and of course,
constructive critics are always welcome.
